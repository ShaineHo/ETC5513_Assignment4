Introduction {.tabset}
======================

Column {data-width=600}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Background

LinkedIn is an illustrious website that helps professionals connect with one another. It is also a portal for people to display their skills as well as the path that their career has taken through the years. It contains a variety of information ranging from education, knowledge to checkpoints in their career.

Employers also use this platform for recruiting professionals. So it is a useful tool which is slowly becoming a necessity for people entering into the corporate world. Navigation and understanding crucial skills for their profession of choice and the location they would flourish goes a long way in crafting a successful career.

### Approach of Project

The report will be charting the trends in LinkedIn across all fields. It will be delving into the kind of skills that are gaining or losing popularity across different verticals as well as what the top few must have skills are for all working professionals.

The other useful component for young professionals is what the migration trends are with respect to their skills and which place would give them space to learn and display their potential.

The final aspect but supremely important one is whether the global employment trends are conducive to their growth. Only upon knowing this aspect is it possible for them to decide whether migration is a good option or upskilling is necessary.


### Information on Data

The World Bank Group - Linkedin Digital Data for Development attempts to harness LinkedIn data covering more than 100 countries. For the purpose of this report the following datasets will be accessed:

- Excel: Industry Skills Needs

Skills {.tabset} 
======================

Column

### Trend of skill categories across the different verticals by year

```{r read-data}
skills_dataset <- readxl::read_excel("../data/public_use-industry-skills-needs.xlsx", sheet = "Industry Skills Needs")
```

```{r}
skill_categ_trend <- skills_dataset %>%

 animate(p,height = 9, width = 7, units = "in", res = 150)


```




Column {data-width=500}
--------------------------

### Trend in change of useful skills across occupations

```{r}
tech_trend <- skills_dataset %>%
  select(year,skill_group_name) %>%
  group_by(year,skill_group_name) %>%
  tally() %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  arrange(desc(n), .by_group = TRUE)

tech_trend <- by(tech_trend, tech_trend["year"], head, n=10)
tech_trend <- Reduce(rbind,tech_trend)

plot_ly(tech_trend) %>%
  add_bars(
    x = ~year, y = ~abs(n),
    frame = ~year, 
    color = ~skill_group_name,
    line = list(simplify = FALSE)
  ) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "Skills trend"))
```




### Analysis

- _Soft skills_ are the one set of skills that people have **increasingly found need** for across all the verticals.
- _Business skills_ are finding **less and less takers** by the year.
- _Specialized industry skills_ seem to have seen volatility as they were **in decline up until 2017-2018** but with the **arrival of 2019 they saw a significant boost in demand**.
- _Disruptive technological skills_ **do not seem to have caught on** yet except for the Information and Communication segment.
- _Mining and Quarrying_ have seen **no disruptive tech skills growth** whatsoever.
- Despite fintech sweeping across the world, among the people employed in the field of _financial and insurance activities_ **little to no technical skills** seem to be visible.

```{r}
skills <- unique(tech_trend$skill_group_name)
```
- The skill that is the most in demand across all years is _`r tech_trend$skill_group_name[1]`_.
- _Business Management, Leadership and Teamwork_ are also right behind. _Business Management_ however has been **in decline since 2017** while _Teamwork_ has **taken the forefront**.
```{r}
skills<- data.frame(skills)
skills_data <- left_join(skills, skills_dataset, by= c("skills" = "skill_group_name")) %>%
  select(skills,skill_group_category) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(skill_group_category) %>%
  tally()


```
- _`r paste(skills_data$skill_group_category[1:4], "-", skills_data$n[1:4], collapse=", ")`_ are the split across the type of skills. _Business skills_ and _Soft skills_ still **dominate**.
- _Specialized Industry skills_ figure in this list too. These are _Research_ and _Foreign Languages_. In an **increasingly interconnected world**, it is quite evident why _Foreign Languages_ make this list. _Research_ also forms the **corner stone of innovation** and is an important skill to possess. Apart from this, _Social media_ is also a **technological main stay** which figures prominently. This is yet another proof of the influence of technology on skills needed.

Talent Migration {.tabset} 
======================

Column {data-width=700}
---------------------------------------------------

### Migration Pattern to USA from other countries

```{r}

talentmig_country <- read.csv("../clean_data/talent_migration_country.csv")
